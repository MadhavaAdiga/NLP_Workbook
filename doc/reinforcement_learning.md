# Reinforcement Learning
* The concept of reinforcement learning is very similar to way humans learn.
* Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. 
* Reinforcement Learning (RL) is the science of decision making. It is about learning the optimal behavior in an environment to obtain maximum reward
* The Reinforcement Learning problem involves an agent exploring an unknown environment to achieve a goal.
* RL is based on the hypothesis that all goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward.
