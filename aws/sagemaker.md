# AWS Sagemaker

* It is a fully managed ML Service.
* Sagemaker makes it easy to build, train and deploy model into production env
* It provides Jupyter notebook instances ready to use
* We can build our own algorithms in sagemaker, but it also provides buld-in high performance algorithms

| built-in algorithms | Own algorithms |
